This is a basic java program I wrote in school using Main only.

It asks for user input to determine which of the following algorithms to use to handle memory allocation:
FIFO - first in first out
LRU - Least Recently Used 
Optimal Page Replacement

it asks you how many frames you would like to test out, and then displays all the pages that are being used.

Afterwards, it shows how many page faults occured while running the algorithm of choice.
